### Notes

Intro: A really important element of our civ, the wheel,

Wikipedia def: _read it_, I think we all know what a wheel is

Shit old > 4500 BC

1st wooden wheel, appear in many areas at the same time, don't know the start, too simple, used in basic things -> horse drawn element, in flat area

2nd spoked wheel, around 1500 BC, reduce weight, but keep a descent strength, use with horse drawn carriages or artillery

no major evolution for a while until, some change with the usage of leather to increase friction, iron and then steel to increase strenght

3rd rubber tires or pneumatic tires

now new problem

---

terrain damage, no simple; 0.5km/h -> enought to create holes in al tires

ok for traction

old aluminium wheel the size of a credit card -> create damage and become useless

nuke reactor -> long term mission

new design: rubber tires? -130Â°C + UV Radiation -> too strong

lunar wheel, not enough strong

alloy nitinol, heat reactive
