An "Organization" named "Semantic"

### Q2

the line

```json
"availability": "http://schema.org/OutOfStock",
```

provide us that the product is out of stock, so the product isn't available for sale.

### Q3

a "Recipe".

## Write a context for existing JSON files

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "Title": "http://schema.org/name",
    "Year": "http://schema.org/date",
    "Rated": "http://schema.org/contentRating",
    "Released": "http://schema.org/Date",
    "Runtime": "http://schema.org/Duration",
    "Genre": "http://schema.org/Genre",
    "Director": "http://schema.org/director",
    "Writer": "http://schema.org/creator",
    "Actors": "http://schema.org/actor",
    "Plot": "http://schema.org/abstract",
    "Language": "http://schema.org/inLanguage",
    "Country": "http://schema.org/countryOfOrigin",
    "Awards": "http://schema.org/award",
    "Poster": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/thumbnailUrl",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
    "Ratings": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/contentRating",
      "@context": {

        "Value": "https://schema.org/ratingValue"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Writing JSON-LD using Schema.org

The previous turtle code was

```turtle
@prefix xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .

@prefix cd: <http://193.49.165.77:8083/clement-defretiere/> .

<>  a ex:Person ;
    ex:name "Antoine Willerval" ;
    ex:desc "Computer science student" ;
    ex:friend cd: ;
    ex:hasLeftNeighbour "Alexandre Martin" ;
    ex:hasRearNeighbour "Mohamed Komah" .

```

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Antoine Willerval",
  "jobTitle": "Computer science student",
  "knows": [
    {
      "@id": "http://193.49.165.77:8083/clement-defretiere/"
    },
    "Alexandre Martin",
    "Mohamed Komah"
  ]
}
```
